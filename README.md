# Login-Form
A simple Login Form as a simple practice on (HTML, PHP, Little CSS, Database) Fundamentals
You can Use it by downloading XAMPP and enable mysql, Apache Services from XAMPP control panel, then copy the files into a folder (name it x for example)
and then move this folder into XAMPP --> htdocs ... open your browser and type localhost/(name of the folder - which we called x- ), and of course dont forget to create the database.
